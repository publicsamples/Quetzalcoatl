Quetzalcoatl is an 8 layer sample playback plugin (VST/AudioUnit) for Mac OS, Windows & Linux (support currently limited to Ubuntu 22+). It performs traditional rompler duties, excelling at pads and evolving textures (or whatever else you fancy), but can also be used for melodic and sequenced material thanks to its comprehensive modulation/sequencing options. In this sense, you can think of it as a kind left-field groovebox.

Quetzalcoatl is inspired by the Aztec deity that shares its name. [Quetzalcoatl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8e1fyzNU-c) (known to the Maya as Kukulkan), represents wisdom, art and the wind. 

An [expanded version](https://modularsamples.gumroad.com/l/lybce) with additional sounds and presets is available for a small fee.

Quetzalcoatl is built with [HISE](http://hise.audio), an open source framework for sample based instruments.
