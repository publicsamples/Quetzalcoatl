Version 2022-10-26

This sound bank is put together by Roberto <roberto@zenvoid.org> for the
FreePats project: http://freepats.zenvoid.org/

FreePats is a project to create a free and open collection of digital
instruments for music production. This sound bank is a partial release of the
General MIDI sound set, in continuous development. More instruments will be
included in subsequent releases.

Instruments contained in this sound set are usually available individually in
higher quality and larger sizes in the FreePats web directory.

This version contains 45 entries for the melodic sound set and 43 entries for
the percussion kit.

 Originally it was Echoes FX, but I've turned it into the instrument #102,
 which I think fits very well.

Comments:
  Samples recorded on August 2020 by Gilles Sadowski, on a bagpipe in G
  designed by Rémy Dubois and built by Olle Geris. The drones were recorded
  separatedly and can be played on the octaves 2 and 3. They are tuned to G in
  the original instrument, so G2 corresponds to the lower drone and G3 the
  higher one. Other notes in the octaves 2 and 3 will play the drones
  transposed.

Comments:
 On February 14th of 2017 there was an event in the auditorium of
 Medialab-Prado center in Madrid (Spain), celebrating the "I love Free
 Software" day proposed by the FSFE. Among many talks and free software
 communities, FreePats was invited to present its project and show a
 demonstration of free sound banks to the public. At the end of the
 presentation, we told the audience that they could help us to record the
 General MIDI instrument number 127 (Applause), which will be subsequently
 published under a free license and included in the new FreePats GM sound
 bank. The wonderful people at the auditorium gifted us with an impressive
 applause that has become our GM instrument #127.

Instruments #1 and #2 have been created from a Kawai upright piano, located in
a living room. Thanks to Inma Martínez de Miguel for kindly letting us access
to her home to play and record the piano.

It was recorded by Gonzalo <humanogonzalo@gmail.com> and Roberto
<roberto@zenvoid.org> on January 2017, using a Zoom H1 portable recorder
mounted on a tripod in front of the piano, approximately at the place where
the head of a piano player would be. The raw recordings were cropped, edited,
and procesed by Roberto, using free software programs.

Instruments #26, #29, #31 and #34 have been created from original sound
samples by FlameStudios: http://www.flamestudios.org/free/GigaSamples

Contains a small subset of samples from the original GIG files. Samples had
been modified, trimmed, background noise has been filtered and some of them
had been edited to generate smooth loop regions.

Samples for instruments #29, #31 and #34 had been greatly modified and
processed through Guitarix virtual amplifier to create different variations of
clean or distorted guitar sounds.

his samples under the FreePats GPL special exception.
